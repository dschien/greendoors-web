            <p> The Digital Green Doors team from the University of Bristolâ€™s Department of Computer Science is
                currently
                investigating how technology can be used to help people gather information about retrofitting when
                attending
                open home events such as <a href="http://www.bristolgreendoors.org/">Bristol Green Doors</a> or <a
                        href="http://freco.org/">Frome Open Homes</a>.</p>

            <p>
                This has resulted in the development of a smartphone application for iPhone and Android that provides a
                number of features to visitors both during and after the event
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Mapping and routing:</b> Users are able to see the location of participating houses and plan
                    their routes.
                </li>
                <li><b>House Details:</b> Visitors can get an overview of the measures installed at a house before they
                    arrive.
                </li>
                <li><b>Note-taking:</b> Notes can be saved to individual houses for later review.</li>
                <li><b>Save Favourites:</b> Individual houses can be saved to a shortlist; for example, users can save
                    the houses
                    they plan to visit, or ones they wish to contact later.
                </li>

                <li><b>Contact:</b> If a user has a question about a measure after their visit, they can use the app to
                    send an
                    email message to the householder. Privacy of both the householder and the app user is protected.
                </li>
                <li><b>Filtering:</b> Houses can be filtered by specific measure, size, location, and opening day.</li>
                <li><b>Scan and Save:</b> Using the <a href="qrcodes.html">QR Scanner</a> within the app, users can scan
                    QR codes at houses that are
                    associated with particular measures. After the event, a <a href="reports.html">report</a> about
                    these measures will be sent to the
                    user.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The most recent version of the Greendoors app will be available to download from 20 February. If you are
                planning to visit Frome Open Homes and would like to take part in our research project about the app,
                please
                contact <a href="mailto:Elaine.Massung@bristol.ac.uk">Elaine</a>. You will have the opportunity to earn
                gift vouchers for your participation.
